# cybersecurity-in-telesurgery

The primary objective of this project is to enhance cybersecurity in robotic
telesurgery by leveraging machine learning models for real-time threat detection.
Given the increasing reliance on networked surgical systems, it is critical to develop
robust security measures that can identify and mitigate potential cyber threats before
they compromise patient safety and operational integrity
